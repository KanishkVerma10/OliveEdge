# OliveEdge 🫒⚔️

OliveEdge is a centralized web platform designed for Indian defence exam aspirants preparing for exams like NDA, CDS, AFCAT, CAPF, and Coast Guard.

## Problem Statement
Information related to defence examinations — such as notifications, syllabus, previous year questions (PYQs), and recommended resources — is scattered across multiple websites and platforms. This fragmentation leads to confusion, inefficiency, and wasted time for aspirants, especially those preparing independently.

## Solution
OliveEdge aims to bring all essential exam-related information into a single, structured, and user-friendly platform. The platform helps aspirants:
- Access accurate and organized exam information
- Avoid unreliable or repetitive resources
- Save time and focus on preparation rather than searching

## Why a Backend-Driven System
Defence exam information is dynamic, high-stakes, and must be accurate. OliveEdge uses a backend-driven architecture to act as a single source of truth, enforce role-based access (admin vs aspirant), and ensure that only verified and structured data is exposed to users. This prevents misinformation and maintains trust in the platform.

## Project Goals
- Build a real-world fullstack web application
-  Design and implement a backend system that manages structured, verified exam data
- Create a placement-ready project with clean architecture
- Solve an actual problem faced by defence aspirants
